How to download MySQL:

Go to https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/ and download the MySQL community installer.

*An account is NOT necessary if it asks you for one. 

Go through the instructions and install the full application when prompted in the installer.

Near the end of the installation it will ask you to set up a password, keep this password written down as it is needed later. 

*If C++ is not installed go to https://www.techspot.com/downloads/6776-visual-c-redistributable-package.html and install it to continue.


If having trouble installing, follow this guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgRwITQHszU


How to setup MySQL for this application: 

Open up the MySQL Workbench
In MySQL Connections create a new connection, keep hostname and port as they are, can change the username Root if desired, the password section of this should be the password set up in the installation. Can test the connectivity of this database by clicking test connection at the bottom
Now that a connection is setup, on the left hand side, select the schema’s tab and right click to create a new one, keep the schema name in mind
Once this schema is created above the schema area on the left, click create a new SQL tab.
In this SQL tab run the following DDL statements in this order to create the database’s schemas:
CREATE TABLE Contract( ContractID INT PRIMARY KEY, StartTime DATETIME, EndTime DATETIME, Salary DECIMAL(10,2), Type VARCHAR(255));

CREATE TABLE Player ( PlayerID INT Primary Key, Fname VARCHAR(255), Lname VARCHAR (255));

CREATE TABLE QB( PlayerID INT PRIMARY KEY, Depth INT, CompletionPercentage DECIMAL(2,2), PassingYards INT, QBR DECIMAL(3,1), TDs INT, FOREIGN KEY(PlayerID) REFERENCES Player(PlayerID) ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE CASCADE);

CREATE TABLE RB( PlayerID INT PRIMARY KEY, Depth INT, YardsPerCarry DECIMAL(3,1), RushingYards INT, Attempts INT, TDs INT, FOREIGN KEY(PlayerID) REFERENCES Player(PlayerID) ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE CASCADE);

CREATE TABLE WR( PlayerID INT PRIMARY KEY, Depth INT, ReceivingYards INT, Targets INT, YardsPerReception DECIMAL(3,1), TDs INT, FOREIGN KEY(PlayerID) REFERENCES Player(PlayerID) ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE CASCADE);

CREATE TABLE Defense( PlayerID INT PRIMARY KEY, Depth INT, Position INT, Tackles INT, Sacks INT, Ints INT, Fumbles INT, FOREIGN KEY(PlayerID) REFERENCES Player(PlayerID) ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE CASCADE);

CREATE TABLE Coach( CoachID INT PRIMARY KEY, Fname VARCHAR(255), Lname VARCHAR(255), Supervisor INT, Title VARCHAR(255), ContractID INT, FOREIGN KEY(ContractID) REFERENCES Contract(ContractID) ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE CASCADE, FOREIGN KEY(Supervisor) REFERENCES Coach(CoachID) ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE CASCADE);

CREATE TABLE CurrentPlayer( PlayerID INT PRIMARY KEY, ContractID INT, CoachID INT, Number INT, UNIQUE(Number), FOREIGN KEY(PlayerID) REFERENCES Player(PlayerID) ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE CASCADE, FOREIGN KEY(ContractID) REFERENCES Contract(ContractID) ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE CASCADE, FOREIGN KEY(CoachID) REFERENCES Coach(CoachID) ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE CASCADE);

CREATE TABLE TradeTarget( PlayerID INT PRIMARY KEY, Fname VARCHAR(255), Lname VARCHAR(255), Team VARCHAR(255), FOREIGN KEY(PlayerID) REFERENCES Player(PlayerID) ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE CASCADE);

CREATE TABLE TradeProposal( TradeID INT PRIMARY KEY, OldPlayer INT, NewPlayer INT, Status VARCHAR(255), AdditionalOffers VARCHAR(255), FOREIGN KEY(OldPlayer) REFERENCES CurrentPlayer(PlayerID) ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE CASCADE, FOREIGN KEY(NewPlayer) REFERENCES TradeTarget(PlayerID) ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE CASCADE);


Once this has all been created then run the following data: 

NOTE: Some of this data was generated by a LLM including fake stats and fake coach names. This was the ONLY use of LLM during this project as allowed per EdDiscussion. More on this in the final report.

7.Now that all the tables and data is set up the database is ready to use!



Where to get the code and how to set up environment to use it:

The code for this application can be found at this github link: https://github.com/pqd5283/TjandParker431Artifact

This repo will need to be cloned into an IDE using git clone.

Once the repo is cloned, python 3.11 needs to be installed and a virtual environment needs to be made in the command line of the IDE using

 python3.11 -m venv venv

then run the command

source venv/bin/activate 

To get into virtual environment

Then the final command to run is 

pip install mysql-connector-python

Once this final command is run the environment to run the code is done and you can run the code.

On starting the code it will prompt you with a log in with four things:

The hostname of the database, the username of the connection, the password to that connection, then the database name all of which should have been set up during previous steps of starting the database.

Once these are inputted and the connection is successful you should be able to start using the application. 



Available Functions:

There are 4 categories of functions: 
View player stats per position, update players, update coaches and open the trade portal.

Within the view player stats, player stats of each position can be viewed. 

Within update players, the user has the option to sign a player, remove a player, update a player’s stats, or resign a player’s contract

Within update coaches the user can either hire or fire coaches

Within the trade portal, a trade can be proposed, accepted, or removed
